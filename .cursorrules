To get the user's Telegram messages from Vibe into the chat: they should add the "Vibe Messages" resource. In Cursor, type @ and look for "Vibe Messages" (from the telegram MCP server) — adding it fetches the latest messages into context.

When working on tasks (especially from Vibe instructions), send progress updates to the Vibe group using the sendMessage tool (dialogId: -5150901335). Prefix every message with "[bot]" (e.g. "[bot] Starting...") so updates are not processed as new tasks.
